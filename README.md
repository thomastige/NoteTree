# NoteTree

This program is a notepad with a tree navigation that supports multiple features:
-Saving and loading a custom file format (.tnt)
-Creation of folder and note nodes
-Ability to rename and move nodes across the tree
-Support for multiple localizations (currently partial support for French and English, can be set by replacing the language code in the properties file)
-Support for basic formatting (bold, underline, strike-through and italic text) through XML-inspired tags
-Support for keyboard shortcuts


NOTE EDITING

To edit an existing text node, click on it in the left-hand navigation menu. This will make its text content appear in the right-hand text panel. When loading a node, it is automatically generated using the built-in generator, allowing the text to be formatted based on the formatting tags. 
To edit the text, click on  the Process menu and click "Edit", or press the relevant keyboard shortcut (default: F2).
